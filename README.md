# Tetris-solver

Purpose/requirements:
- Create a program that can take tetris shapes from a file and place them in the smallest possible square
- Leaks are not a concern for this project
- Can not segfault or quit in any unexpected manner

What I learned:
- I leared how to use/understand recursive backtracking
- A simple understanding of data structures
- How to parse simple information

Overall I am not a big fan of this project. While I loved creating the solving algorithm for the tetris pieces,
this project was too difficult for how early on it was assigned. My code is terrible for this project and if I ever
have the time I am going to start from scrath and resubmit my project.
